Elixir rewrite of my A\* graph pathfinding code, which I did 
in Python, Erlang and Racket.

This version aims to be as generic as possible, abstracting away the graph info
and the heuristic distance - you provide both as funtions.

If you'd like, you can also think of it as the *star of Ea* - if you are
a fan of Tolkien writings ;).
